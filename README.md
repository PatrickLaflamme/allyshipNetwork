# Allyship Network Simulation Software

This project was created for the Social Identity Lab. Its intended purpose is to simulate the effect of sexism and allyship in simulated corporate environments. This simulation is gender agnostic, meaning that both genders are assumed to be equally likely to be sexist or allies.

## Dependencies

This project is built primarily using javascript, and leverages the following resources

1. (D3.js)[D3js.org]
 * To visualize the network during the simulation
 * It also has some useful helper functions to calculate statistics such as mean and sd
 
2. (D3legend.js)[http://d3-legend.susielu.com/]
 * To create appealing legends for the visualization

3. (Seedrandom.js)[https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom]
 * To control the seed used to randomly generate the network and assign node identities.
